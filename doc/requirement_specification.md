Since our beginning, the shop's populatiry grew rapidly, our store expanded in size and as a result, we gained new partners too. Currently we're only available for customers that can visit our local store in Eger, and some of our customers travel to us from a different city too.

After choosing their desired product, they have the option to purchase it on the website. After that, our team can see the order on the website, and manage it.
